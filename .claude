# Zoom G3X MIDI Controller - Claude Guidelines

## Project Overview
Python application to modify and control patches on a Zoom G3X guitar effects pedal over USB using MIDI.

## Core Principles

### 1. Simplicity & Minimalism
- Keep the total number of files to a minimum
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions and complexity
- Prefer straightforward, readable code over clever solutions
- Organize code in a simple, flat structure when possible

### 2. Dependency Management
- **Prefer standard library** whenever possible
- Only add external dependencies if they:
  - Significantly reduce complexity
  - Are popular and widely maintained
  - Are readily available via pip
- Document all dependencies clearly in requirements.txt

### 3. Environment & Execution
- **Always verify the virtual environment is activated** before running code
- **Always check dependencies are installed** before executing
- Use appropriate error messages if environment is not set up correctly
- Remind user to activate environment if needed

### 4. Communication
- **Ask clarifying questions** when instructions are unclear or ambiguous
- Don't make assumptions about MIDI implementation details
- Confirm understanding of Zoom G3X-specific requirements before implementing
- Verify approach with user for non-trivial changes

## Pre-execution Checklist
Before running any Python code:
1. Check if virtual environment exists and is activated
2. Verify required packages are installed
3. Inform user if setup steps are needed

## Project Structure
Keep it simple - avoid over-engineering the file structure.
